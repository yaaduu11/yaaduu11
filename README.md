# Hy, I'm Yadukrishnan

I’m the kind of person who breaks stuff just to figure out how it works and then builds something better from it.

From tweaking tiny scripts to scaling full-stack applications, I live for the “what if I try this?” moments.  
Whether it's open-source contributions or late-night code experiments, I’m always chasing that sweet spot between curiosity and creation.

Always tinkering.
